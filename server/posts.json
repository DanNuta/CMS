      "description": "Leverkusen have been flying in 2023 under Xabi Alonso, beating Monaco, Ferencvaros and Union Saint-Gilloise on their way to the Europa League last four. They're also pushing hard for a top-six finish in the Bundesliga following a slow start to the campaign under Alonso's predecessor Gerardo Seoane. A shock 2-1 defeat to Cologne ended a 14-match unbeaten run in all competitions, but the fact the game was brought forward a couple of days should give Die Werkself a welcome edge in their bid to emulate Bundesliga rivals and Europa League holders Eintracht Frankfurt. Not that star man Diaby is showing any signs of fatigue during the run-in. The France international made it 16 goal contributions this Bundesliga season with the assist for Amine Adli's equaliser in the Rhine derby. In-form youngster Florian Wirtz also came through unscathed, while 2022 World Cup-winning midfielder Exequiel Palacios made his injury comeback in the second half. Adli was preferred to Adam Hlozek as the lone striker, but roles could be reversed in the Italian capital. Iran's Sardar Azmoun is another proven alternative in the absence of Czech international Patrik Schick, whose season has been ended by injury.",
